# GuessingGame

Number Guesser

This project is part of my Front-End Engineer course. It involves building a small guessing game using JavaScript functions. The code runs in the browser, and you can test the functions and view any errors in the browser's console. The project requirements include writing four functions in script.js, which are called by game.js based on user interactions. The project incorporates HTML/CSS for the website.

To run the project, open script.js in a text editor, and open index.html in a browser. Enjoy the challenge of building this interactive game!
